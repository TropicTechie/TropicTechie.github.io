Just a techy guy from the tropics in Belize. This is my home, part code cave, part compliance beach shack. By day, I assess risks, chase audit trails, and hunt privilege creep. By night, I sip something cold and wonder why that thing’s still running as root.

I assess risks for a living, which is a fun way of saying I point at things, raise one eyebrow, and say “hmm, that’s probably not great.” I believe in least privilege and strong encryption. If it looks like I’m relaxing, don’t worry — I’m thinking about risk. Just... very casually. And yes, I’ll absolutely ask why that access hasn’t been reviewed since 2022

Let’s keep it breezy.
